## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.(Challenge intendeds for Mobile and Desktop devices only.)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load.
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap grid
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScrit/Jquery
- Leaflet JS Map Library
- Ipify IP Geolocation API

### What I learned

When developing this IP Address Tracker website project, these are new things, I have learned.

-How e-commerce website's frontend works
-Also, this is my very first time that using **UI Popups** instead of **Browser alerts**. The advantage of UI Popups instead of alrt is that UI Popup far more attractive than regular browser alert. I used UI Popups to indicate following scenarios.
* When user clicking **Add to cart** button without choosing product count.
* When user deducting product counter value **Less than 0**.

-After viewing a Popup, I used **setTimeOut** function to automatically hide the popups after certain amount of time. Code snippet is right below.
```JS
setTimeout(() => {
    quantPop.style.display = 'none';
    quantPop.addClass("popup-hide");
}, 2000);
```
-Most importantly, this my very first project that I used my own method for navigating image slideshow. It's a bit repetative and entry level method but I intend to modify the code in future.

### Continued development

As I mentioned earlier, the main point I should improve is the **Slider navigation** JS code segment. Apart from that following things should improve too.
* I have used some CSS media queries that usually not using when developing a website. The reason to do that is, I noticed some UI errors on external monitors with 1920px X 1080px displays. In order to resolve those I added **min-width=1900px** media query.

### Useful resources

- [Borislav Hadzhiev](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-hide-element-after-few-seconds) - This helped me for showing the way to hide the popups automatically.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/820951/hide-div-after-a-few-seconds) - I followed this thread also. This is the jQuery version of above **setTimeOut** function.
